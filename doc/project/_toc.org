* [[https://gettyped.github.io/][Get Typed /motivations for using static types/]]

Early stage project intended to become a compendium of information on
- why static types are useful,
- examples of them in action, and
- implementations of useful types in various languages.

Written in [[http://orgmode.org/][org mode]] with [[lit][literate programming via org-babel]] so that the example
implementations are “tangled” into their own source projects for compilation and
testing.

The primary aim is padagogical, so where possible there will be pointers to
existing projects better suited for real-world use.
